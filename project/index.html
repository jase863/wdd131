                Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is the most common type of 3D printing. 
                It works by heating plastic filament and pushing it through a nozzle. 
                Just like CNC machines, 3D printers use G-Code to move in a predetermined
                path, depositing the plastic layer by layer to form a solid object<br>
                <br>
                FDM printing is fairly easy to learn, and the
                materials are cheaper than other printing options. This makes it a great
                choice for prototyping. The materials are also relatively strong compared
                to other methods of 3D printing. However, there are downsides to using FDM
                printers. For instance, they are a lot slower than other methods, and their
                surface finishes don't look quite as nice.
